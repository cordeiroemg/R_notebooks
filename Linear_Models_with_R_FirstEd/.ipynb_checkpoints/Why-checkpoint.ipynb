    "## What is multilevel regression modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A model in which the coefficients vary by school, $y = \\alpha_j + \\beta_jx + error$ where the subscripts $j$ index schools\n",
    "* A model with more than one variance component (student-level and school-level variation)\n",
    "* Regression with many predictors, including an indicator variable for each school in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilevel model: regression in which the paramters (regression coefficients) are given a probability model\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key parts of a multilevel  model are varying coefficients and a model for those varying coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models for regression coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume two multilevel models; one **student-level** predictor $x$ (pre-test score) and one **school-level** predictor $u$ (average parent's incomes)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Varying-intercept model\n",
    "Those regressions have the **same slope** in each school and only the **intercepts vary**\n",

    "\n",
    "Multilevel models are often nown as random-effects or mixed-effects models. The regression coefficients that are being modeled are called *random effects*. *Fixed effects* correspond either to parameters that do not vary and are being tested. *Mixed-effects* are models that include both fixed and random effects\n",
